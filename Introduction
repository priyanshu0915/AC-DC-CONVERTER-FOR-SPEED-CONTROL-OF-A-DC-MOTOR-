        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            This project focuses on the development of a two-stage AC-DC converter designed to control the speed of a DC motor. 
            The main objective is to efficiently convert AC input to a stable, adjustable DC output, allowing precise control over 
            the motor speed through voltage regulation.
        </p>
        <p>
            The two-stage converter architecture comprises:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Rectification Stage:</strong> Converts alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC).</li>
                <li><strong>Regulation Stage:</strong> Employs a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) technique to adjust the output voltage, 
                enabling controlled motor speed.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            This AC-DC converter design has applications in various fields requiring stable DC motor speed control, 
            such as robotics, industrial automation, and electronic projects where motor precision is essential.
